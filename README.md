# MasteringSQLforData

This repository is a personal learning resource to master SQL for data analysis.  
It contains a structured 4-week roadmap from basics to advanced topics, practical exercises, and project ideas.  
The focus is on building strong SQL skills to extract, manipulate, and analyze data effectively.

---

## Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the foundational skill for querying and managing data stored in relational databases.  
This repository guides you through a progressive learning path with clear weekly goals:

- Week 1: SQL Basics  
- Week 2: Intermediate SQL & JOINs  
- Week 3: Advanced SQL & Window Functions  
- Week 4: Complex Queries with CTEs and Subqueries  

By following this roadmap, you will be able to write efficient SQL queries, perform complex data transformations, and prepare data for further analysis in Python or other tools.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: SQL Basics

- Understand relational database concepts: tables, rows, columns, keys  
- Learn basic CRUD operations:  
  - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE  
- Filtering data with WHERE, DISTINCT, ORDER BY  
- Aggregations: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX  
- Grouping data using GROUP BY and filtering groups with HAVING  
- Practice simple queries on online platforms or sample datasets  

---

### Week 2: Intermediate SQL â€” JOINs and Combining Data

- Understand relational databases and table relationships  
- Master JOIN types: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN  
- Write subqueries and nested queries  
- Use set operations: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT  
- Practice complex multi-table queries  

---

### Week 3: Advanced SQL & Optimization

- Learn Common Table Expressions (CTEs) using WITH clauses  
- Advanced window functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()  
- Use CASE statements and conditional logic in queries  
- Work with date/time and string functions  
- Understand basic indexing and query optimization concepts  
- Practice writing efficient and readable queries  

---

### Week 4: Complex Queries with CTEs and Subqueries

- Deepen knowledge of CTEs and subqueries  
- Solve real-world analytical problems requiring multi-step queries  
- Combine aggregation, filtering, window functions, and joins in complex scenarios  
- Build a mini project using a real-world dataset (e.g., Kaggle e-commerce or COVID-19 data)  
- Create data summaries and dashboards by writing SQL queries  

---

## Practice Examples: Window Functions & Analytical Queries

### Window Functions

- **ROW_NUMBER()**: Assign sequential row numbers within partitions  
- **RANK()** and **DENSE_RANK()**: Assign ranks with and without gaps  
- **LAG()** and **LEAD()**: Access previous or next rows in ordered partitions  

**Example exercises:**  
- Top N employees per department  
- Latest order per customer  
- Ranking students by exam score  
- Comparing monthly revenues

### Common SQL Concepts and Questions

- Types of JOINs and their use cases  
- Primary keys and foreign keys explained  
- Aggregate functions overview  
- Differences between LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN  
- Basics of database normalization and its purpose  

---

## Suggested Approach

- Dedicate time each week to theory, practice, and mini exercises  
- Write and test queries using a SQL environment or online playground  
- Keep notes of challenging concepts and revisit them  
- Gradually build complexity from single-table queries to multi-table analytics  
- Document your learning progress and key query patterns in this repo

## Final Notes

This repository is a personal study guide and reference to track SQL mastery for data analysis roles.  
It will serve as the foundation before moving to statistics, Python, and data projects.
